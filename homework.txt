1. "git branch" creates a new branch;
2. Fast-forward merging is when simple merging between two branches takes place.
Recursive merging is when we have multiple changes in multiple files that do
not have a specific timeline.;
3."git checkout" changes to another branch;
"git branch -d" or "git branch -D" deletes a branch;
4. Merge conflicts happen when we have multiple changes in the same file across
different branches. In this case git lets us chose which change we want to keep.
